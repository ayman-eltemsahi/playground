### TSP with Genetic Algorithm
A solution to The travelling salesman problem using genetic algorithm. The algorithm keeps working with generations of solutions to get to an optimal solution for the problem.
The location of the cities is generated randomly every time.
Available parameters:
    - **Number of cities**: the number of cities that the algorithm will try to find a solution for.
    - **Population size**: the size of the population used internally in the genetic algorithm.
    - **Mutation rate**: the rate of applying mutations on the resulting children in the new population in the genetic algorithm.
    - **Stop after**: the number of generations with no better solution after which the algorithm will stop.
