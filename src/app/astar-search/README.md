Creates a space with many obstacles and tries to find the best path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. If there is no solution and the algorithm gets stuck, a new space will be created and restarted.
Available parameters:
    - **Columns**: the number of columns.
    - **Rows**: the number of rows.
    - **Obstacle rate**: the ration of the created obstacles in relation to the entire space. Having a high rate of obstacles might create an impossible space to work.
